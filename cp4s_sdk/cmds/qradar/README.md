# QRadar
This module is a mock of the QRadar App SDK. At the time of writing the SDK is only available on the App Exchange and I did not want to include the entire SDK 
until we can download and install it as a dependency like the other SDK packages

My hope is to see the QRadar App SDK as its own open source code package. The benefit of this is we would be able to directly import it as a package and have it as a dependency to be downloaded from Pypi using Pip.
