# App Exchange (Appx)
This module is pretty much entirely new ground. Until now we had no tool to interact with the App Exchange and I feel this will be the start of a journey towards providing a developer friendly mechanism to interact with the App Exchange. 

There is alot of power in such an idea. Imagine a future where cyber analysts and security developers can from a terminal publish a new code package to the AppX rather than fill out a form. As well as streamlined publishing, workloads can be built into the system to delight out developer communities with pre-submission validations meaning each developer in our community catch these things early and can reduce their time-to-submission.

In my humble opinion I think the App Exchange has the potential to be the commercial gateway to open security (quote me on that). With the right investments and a suitable suite of new functionalities to make the packaging and publishing process easy for our customers.
